# SocialMediaApp
 There are a no. of steps that you need to follow to use this full-stack application:
 1. install the required dependencies for frontend, use the terminal in the client folder and run: npm install.
    
 2.install the required dependencies for backend, use the terminal in the server folder and run: npm install.
 
 3. In the server folder using the terminal do: npm init -y.

 4. Make a .env file in the server folder. This will contain three variables, MONGO_URL(the url you get from making a mongo database), Port(this should be 3001),
   and JWT_SECRET(which should be a string of your choice).

 5. Run the server by using (node index.js or nodemon index.js) and run the react app using (npm start).
    
 6. Enjoy :)
